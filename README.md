**Tool CLI**

Tool is a skeletal command-line utility designed as a foundation for future enhancements. It provides basic CLI functionality and allows user configuration via package.json. Currently, users can modify settings by adding a toolConfig field in their project's package.json. Installation can be done globally using npm install -g tool or locally with npm install tool --save-dev. Future updates may introduce advanced configuration options and additional features. Contributions are welcome to expand its capabilities.
